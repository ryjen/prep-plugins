These are the default plugins for [prep](https://github.com/ryjen/prep)

These are under development and have two flavours so far:

## Compiled Plugins

Are built with prep and the binaries are compressed and embedded into prep itself. They are extracted to new repositories. Could be considered somewhat more secure.

## Script Plugins

Are packaged as part of an install script, lighter weight and easier to debug.

## TODO

- [ ] use compiled libraries (libgit, etc) and remove dependencies on shell commands
